First 3 = owner permissions
Next 3 = group permissions
Last 3 = others permissions
How does a normal user change a password without root permission?
Because of SUID.

SUID (Set user ID)--> When a file with SUID is executed, it runs with the permissions of the file’s OWNER, not the user who runs it. 
        Purpose: Allow normal users to run specific commands that require higher (owner/root) privileges.
        rwsr-xr-x
          ^
          ‘s’ in the user (owner) execute position
numeric code: 4xxx
Set SUID: chmod 4755 file
Remove SUID: chmod u-s file
Instead of r w x, we see r w s.

Meaning of that s:

When ANYONE runs this file (normal user),
the system temporarily gives them the owner’s identity.

SGID (Set Group ID) --> For Files & Directories , File executes with the group’s permissions, not the user’s group.
rwxr-sr-x
      ^
      ‘s’ in group execute position
Numeric Code: 2xxx
            All files created inside the directory automatically inherit the directory’s group.
Purpose: Ensures team collaboration inside shared directories.
Set SGID: chmod 2755 folder
Remove SGID: chmod g-s folder
Shared team folder:  /projects/devops/
                      Every file created inside will belong to group devops.
Sticky Bit —> For Directories Only, Inside a directory with Sticky Bit, users can delete only their own files, even if they have write permission.
Purpose:     Protects files in shared directories.
Symbol in permissions:
drwxrwxrwt
         ^
         ‘t’ in others execute position
Numeric Code:1xxx
Set Sticky Bit:
                  chmod 1755 folder
Remove Sticky Bit:
                  chmod o-t folder
Real Example:
            /tmp directory in Linux:
drwxrwxrwt
Everyone can write, but cannot delete each other's files.
