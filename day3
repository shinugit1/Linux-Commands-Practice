1. ps --> Process Status - Shows currently running processes with process IDs.
  e.g. type -- > ps      (Shows processes of current terminal only)
            -- > ps -ef  (Shows all running processes in the system)
            -- >    ps -e  (-e = every process)
             -- >   ps -f  (-f = full format or detailed information about processes)
             -- >  ps -u  (-u = user format or Displays processes with user-focused details/
                         ps -u username → Processes of Specific User)
            -- > ps aux  (Another popular way to see all processes with details)
                        It comes from BSD style options:
                            a → show processes of all users
                            u → show user details
                            x → show processes without a terminal (TTY)
  
| Column | Meaning                 |
| ------- | ---------------------- |
| USER    | Owner of the process   |
| PID     | Process ID             |
| %CPU    | CPU usage              |
| %MEM    | Memory usage           |
| VSZ     | Virtual memory size    |
| RSS     | Physical memory (RAM)  |
| TTY     | Terminal               |
| STAT    | Process state          |
| START   | Start time             |
| TIME    | CPU time               |
| COMMAND | Command with arguments-CMD |

   STAT column (very important)
| Code | Meaning       |
| ---- | ------------- |
| R    | Running       |
| S    | Sleeping      |
| D    | Waiting (I/O) |
| Z    | Zombie        |
| T    | Stopped       |

  6️⃣ ps aux vs ps -ef (Common Interview Question)
| Feature           | ps aux      | ps -ef            |
| ----------------- | ----------- | ----------------- |
| Option style      | BSD         | UNIX              |
| CPU/MEM info      | ✅ Yes       | ❌ No              |
| Parent PID        | ❌ No        | ✅ Yes             |
| Daemon visibility | ✅ Yes       | ✅ Yes             |
| Most used for     | Performance | Process hierarchy |
 

2. top --> 👉 Shows running processes in real-time (live). aka Linux ka Task Manager.
  
  What you see in top:
CPU usage, Memory usage, Load average, Running processes (updated every few seconds)

  Useful keys inside top
| Key | Action         |
| --- | -------------- |
| `q` | Quit top       |
| `k` | Kill a process |
| `M` | Sort by memory |
| `P` | Sort by CPU    |

3. kill --> Stop a Process  - 👉 Stops (kills) a running process using PID.
Basic command
  kill PID
  Force kill (strong)
  kill -9 PID
| Signal | Meaning               |
| ------ | --------------------- |
| `15`   | Polite stop (default) |
| `9`    | Force stop            |

4. nice -->👉 Decides how much CPU priority a process gets.
 
  Priority rule (important)
    Lower nice value = higher priority
    Higher nice value = lower priority
Range:  
-20  (highest priority)
  0  (default)
 19  (lowest priority)

Run process with priority
nice -n 10 command
e.g.  nice -n 10 python script.py ➡️ Script will run slowly, CPU kam lega

Process: An instance of a running program. 
Thread: The smallest unit of a CPU's utilization, subordinate to a process. 
PID: Process ID, a unique identifier for each process.
